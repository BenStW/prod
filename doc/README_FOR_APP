= Overview


== User Administration
For User administration the gem "devise" is used.
The model User is the central model, as all other models are somehow connected to the user.

== CalendarEvent
Each user can define CalendarEvent's, which are the hourly events defined in his calendar.

== Friendship
The users can establish Friendship's between each other. 
Each Friendship is created twice: for a friendship of user1 to user2 a friendship of user2 to user1 is also created.

== WorkSession
If friends choose the same CalendarEvent (same day and hour), then they share the same WorkSession.
A WorkSession is a set of CalendarEvent's of the same time of different users.

== Room
Each WorkSession is 1:1 associated with a Room.
A Room contains the technical data for a specific video chat.

For each user one room is created.
If one user creates a CalendarEvent when no friend has a CalendarEvent at this time, 
then a WorkSession with the users room is created.

If one user creates a CalendarEvent when a friend has already a CalendarEvent (and therefore a WorkSession) at this time,
then the WorkSession (and its Room) of the friend is used.
   
== TokboxApi
The used video chat functionality is provided by TokBox.
The model TokboxApi generates the TokBox Sessions and the TokBox tokens.
A Room contains a fix TokBox Session and for each member of WorkSession a TokBox token is generated.

== Invitation
The Invitation model and controller are used to send an invitation to email addresses provided by the user.

== InterestedUser
The InsterestedUser model allows to leave an email address on the first page without signing up.

== Other models and controllers
The connections model and controller as well as the statistics controller are currently not (really) used.

== ActiveAdmin
This gem is quite useful to analyse the data over a good admin frontend.
Use it by calling http://localhost:3000/admin
